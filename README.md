Deep Learning For Chaotic Time Series Forecasts 


Here I investigate the ability of Deep Learning Models such as LSTM networks for the prediction of nonlinear chaotic time series. 
Due to the extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, chaotic systems are inherently unpredictable. Dispite this challenge recent advancements in Machine Learning, 
specifically recurrant neural network architectures have been experiencing increased succsess in this relm. 

This is an independent project of mine started in December 2023 and inspired by recent research across the field. 

My primary Goals are too 

1) Investigate the difference in the forecast horizon of sable and chaotic parameterizations of the same dynamic system.
2) Understand the scailing of the forecast horizon with the length of the observed data.
3) Understand the sensitivity of forecasts to increased observation noise.
