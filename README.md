# Machine Learning for Chaotic Time Series Forecasts

Welcome to the "Machine Learning for Chaotic Time Series Forecasts" project! This independent project, initiated in December 2023, explores the application of Machine Learning Models, particularly LSTM networks, for predicting nonlinear chaotic time series. Chaotic systems, known for their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, pose a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. However, recent advancements in Machine Learning, especially recurrent neural network architectures, show promise in handling such chaotic systems.

## Project Overview

The project currently focuses on multi-step and single-step forecasts of the logistic map, serving as a foundational for future exploration of chaotic time series prediction. The goal is to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of Machine Learning for chaotic systems in various environments of data availability and noise. 

## Current Status

As of now, initial tests have been conducted on both multi-step and single-step forecasts of the logistic map. The project is in its early stages, and additional experiments, analyses, and implementations are planned to expand its scope.
