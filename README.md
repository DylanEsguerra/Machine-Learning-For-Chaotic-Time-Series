# Deep Learning for Chaotic Time Series Forecasts

Welcome to the "Deep Learning for Chaotic Time Series Forecasts" project! This independent project, initiated in December 2023, explores the application of Deep Learning Models, particularly LSTM networks, for predicting nonlinear chaotic time series. Chaotic systems, known for their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions, pose a significant challenge for traditional forecasting methods. However, recent advancements in Machine Learning, especially recurrent neural network architectures, show promise in handling such chaotic systems.

## Project Overview

The project currently focuses on multi-step and single-step forecasts of the logistic map, serving as a foundational for future exploration of chaotic time series prediction. The goal is to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of Deep Learning for chaotic systems in various environments of data availability and noise. 

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Investigate Forecast Horizon Differences:**
   - Examine and compare the forecast horizon of stable and chaotic parameterizations within the same dynamic system.

2. **Explore Scaling with Observed Data Length:**
   - Understand how the forecast horizon scales in relation to the length of the observed data.

3. **Assess Sensitivity to Observation Noise:**
   - Analyze the sensitivity of forecasts to increased observation noise, considering its impact on prediction accuracy.

## Current Status

As of now, initial tests have been conducted on both multi-step and single-step forecasts of the logistic map. The project is in its early stages, and additional experiments, analyses, and implementations are planned to expand its scope.
